##Purpose
To develop a prediction model and envision how the results of the prediction may shape decision-making by the primary stakeholder, which might be patients, physicians, insurance companies, policymakers or others. 

## Dataset
National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2014
The survey is designed to provide information such as use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco, mental health and general demographics among members of United States households aged 12 and older. (155,271) 

## Result
Naive-bayes and Random Forest are used for creating the models and compared. There is no significant difference between the two.
